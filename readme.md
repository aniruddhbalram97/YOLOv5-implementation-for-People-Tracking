## **Introduction**
Human (N>=1) obstacle detector and tracker based on C++ and OpenCV that employ a computer vision algorithm for location and categorization of human(N>=1) in the picture.
We are seeking to create this tracker utilizing a monocular camera, directly usable in a robot’s reference frame according to the need specifications supplied to us by ACME robotics .

For human recognition and tracking, we will use the robust YOLOv3 neural network model trained on the COCO dataset, which is one of the most accurate real-time object detection techniques.

Humans detected in the frame can be seen below:

### **Output Frame:**
The application predicts the main 4 humans as well as the one behind (barely-visible)

### **Notes**

- Doxyfile is found in Code/doc_directory/Doxyfile 
Tasks 

- IB: 1.108, IB: 1.104 and IB. 2. 210  may be implemented incorectly due to build methods 


## **Overview and purpose:**
This program allows an image to be fed into the program, creating bounding boxes around every detected human. The goal is to use this program and make a human tracker out of it, with the input being a video feed. 

In the current program, the input image is a picture of people on a zebra-crossing (found in ./app). The methods to build and run the program is shown in the bottom of this readme. The header file `constants.hpp`, defines important constant values for the program such as blob size, image size, filter thresholds, interface colours and font properties. The header file `object_detection.hpp` initializes the two classes used in this program. Both classes' methods are defined in the implementation file found in ./app.

The two classes used in this program are `BlobGenerator` and `HumanObjectDetector`. 

The class `BlobGenerator` converts an image into blob and allows us to retrieve it.`BlobGenerator::generateBlobFromImage()` allows an image to be inputted and creates a blob from it. 

`BlobGenerator::getBlob()` returns a blob as Mat datatype. 

Derived from BlobGenerator by inheritance, the `HumanObjectDetector` class is used to detect humans in an image. This includes methods to draw bounding boxes, creating labels, prediction(pre-processing) and post-processing. 

`HumanObjectDetector:: labelBox()` is used to draw a label around the 'class-text,' creating a label for the detected object, which is contained in a rectangle.

`HumanObjectDetector::preProcessAlgorithm()` forward propagates the blob into the yolo network. It is trained on COCO-2017 dataset to obtain properties such as confidence and class prediction. 

`HumanObjectDetector:: postProcessAlgorithm()` filters out the low confidence and low-score classes matches labels the prediction with highest probability class. 

`HumanObjectDetector::applyNMSAndAppendRectanglesToImage()` applies Non Maximal Supression and eliminates the redundant overlapping bounding boxes.

For phase 2, there are new classes and functions. 
`HumanObjectDetector::objectDetectorModel()` Combined post and pre-processing methods 

Class `Camera` contain the functions required to use the webcam, and detect a person 

`Camera::getImageInput()` receives a matrix, which is the image frame received from an .png or webcam stream, depending on the value of bool live in `Camera::runLiveDetector(bool live)`.

`Camera::runLiveDetector(bool live, bool test)` if bool live is true, then the program will receive inputs from a webcam stream. If bool live is false, then a .png will be the input.

### **Generate Doxygen document:**
- **Step1:** creates a Doxyfile  
```
doxygen -g
```  

- **Step 2:** Edit the Doxyfile (INPUT and PROJECT_NAME)  

- **Step 3:** To generate html and latex folder  
doxygen ./Doxyfile. (_Once thats done, two folders will be created html and latex, the html folder has index.html which will have the doxygen data_)  

- **Step 4:** INPUT parameter in Doxyfile is the files you want to run doxygen on PROJECT_NAME parameter is the name of the title

- **Step 5:**: Open the Doxygen html file.
```
cd Docs/html
firefox index.html
```

### **Steps to Run test:**
```
./test/cpp-test 
```
 
### **Steps to Build and Run Demo:** 
```
# Create build directory and switch into it
mkdir -p build && cd build

# to run without coverage
cmake ..
make

# App run
./app/shell-app

# Test run
./test/cpp-test

# to run with coverage
cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../
make
# to make code_coverage
make code_coverage

# In /ENPM808X---Midterm-Project/app/main.cpp, cam.runLiveDetector(true, false) will run object detection the webcam.
# cam.runLiveDetector(false, false) will object detection for a sample .png in place in /ENPM808X---Midterm-Project/app/
