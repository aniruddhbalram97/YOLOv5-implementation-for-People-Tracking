### Introduction
Human (N>=1) obstacle detector and tracker based on C++ and OpenCV that employ a computer vision algorithm for location and categorization of human(N>=1) in the picture.
We are seeking to create this tracker utilizing a monocular camera, directly usable in a robot’s reference frame according to the need specifications supplied to us by ACME robotics .

For human recognition and tracking, we will use the robust YOLOv3 neural network model trained on the COCO dataset, which is one of the most accurate real-time object detection techniques.
